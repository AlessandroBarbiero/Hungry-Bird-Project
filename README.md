# Hungry Bird
Final Project for the Computer Graphic course.

3D game inspired by Angry Birds created using `Vulkan` as graphical library without an external game engine.\
The .frag and .vert shaders are written in __GLSL__.\
The collisions are handled implementing an Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (__AABB__) algorithm.

The game consists of hitting the pigs moving the cannon, adjusting the power and shooting the birds.\
When all the pigs have been hit the game ends and the player win.
